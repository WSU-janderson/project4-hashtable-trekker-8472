# Project 4 - HashTable

Project description can be found [in the repo](Project4_HashTable.pdf)

Place your complexity analysis below.


For the most part, the requested functions are best case T(N) = c constant, there is always the chance you could get immediate results. However, worst case is T(N) = N because there is the possibility one could be required to iterate through the whole table in a linear function.
